# ML-Age_Prediction_of_Sea_Slugs_KNN_Regression

I have created Machine Learning Model With KNN Regressor for Age Predictions of Sea Slugs.

In this I've used Python’s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Pandas](), [Matplotlib](), [Seaborn](), and [Sklearn]() for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

**Download the dataset from [here]()!**

# The Abalone Problem Statement

* The age of an abalone can be found by cutting its shell and counting the number of rings on the shell. In the Abalone Dataset, you can find the age measurements of a large number of abalones along with a lot of other physical measurements.

* The goal of the project is to develop a model that can predict the age of an abalone based purely on the other physical measurements. This would allow researchers to estimate the abalone’s age without having to cut its shell and count the rings.

***I've applied a kNN to find the closest prediction score possible. Follow [notebook]() for more!!***

# Comparison of the Three Models

***In three incremental steps, I’ve pushed the predictive performance of the algorithm. The following table shows a recap of the different models and their performances:***

| **MODEL**  | **ERROR** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Arbitrary k  | 2.37  |
| GridSearchCV for k  | 2.17  |
| GridSearchCV for k and weights | 2.1634 |


# Conclusion

In this Project I:

* Understand the mathematical foundations behind the kNN algorithm.
* Code the kNN algorithm from scratch in NumPy.
* Use the scikit-learn implementation to fit a kNN with a minimal amount of code.
* Use GridSearchCV to find the best kNN hyperparameters.
